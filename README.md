# burger

## Overview

This project, I was to use the MVC model to create an "Eat-Da-Burger" App. Through the use of this model, handlebars, express server, and databases I was able to create an application with both front and back end programming. The finished app allows users to click on a burger to devour that burger would be moved to the devour section and no longer be interactable. A user may also add a burger through forms and inuputs and submit a new burger to be added to the potential devour burgers section of the page.
